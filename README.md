# cnidariaVEGFs
Phylogenetic analysis of cnidaria VEGFs

The python script generates the alignment of Figure 2. The tree of Figure 3 (expanded set of PDGFs/VEGFs) is simply generated by running the PhyML analysis with the command:

    mpirun -n 4 phyml-mpi --no_memory_check -s NNI -i cnidaria_VEGFs_without_duplicates_mod.phy -d aa -b -1

Note that in order to generate bootstrap replicates, you should replace "b = -1" with the actual number of desired replicates (1000 was used for this manuscript). -1 performs a quick approximate likelihood ratio test returning aLRT statistics (see the PhyML manual for details). The script requires 'mpirun' in order to distribute the calculations to as many processors as your machine has (specified e.g. by "-n = 4").
